            Hello my friends! My name is Robert Tansill and I currently live in sunny San Diego, CA.  I'm originally from a small town called Fernley, NV and lived on a small ranch.  That being said, I have some hilarious and interesting stories of my childhood.  One that particullary stands out is when my pet goat, Rosie, followed my brother and I on to the school bus.  All the kids wanted to pet her and chased after her.  She ran away and pooped little pellets down the walking isle.  The kids literally scared the sh%& out of her!

            After graduating high school I became quite the nomad.  I moved several times to places such as: Idaho, Hawaii, and Northern Ca.  I eventually wound up in San Diego and couldn't be happier!  There is so much to do here.  There is the ocean, mountains, and city life so regardless your preference you are satisfied.  I'm currently raising a beautiful boy and attending Upenn's Full Stack Development Academy.  I plan on becoming a software engineer and eventually creating my own app and website!  Thanks for reading!
